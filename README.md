# Lab 1: Introduction to OOP Classes

## Description
This project demonstrates fundamental Object-Oriented Programming principles in C#, focusing on abstraction, encapsulation, and object management.

## Objectives
* Analyze a domain and define class structures.
* Implement classes with private fields, public properties, and behavioral methods.
* Manage object lifecycles in a console application.

## Implementation
**Domain:** Astronomy
**Class:** `Planet`

The application allows the user to manage a collection of `Planet` objects with specific constraints and validation.

### Key Features
* **Encapsulation:** usage of private fields, public getters/setters, and Enums.
* **Validation:** Input verification for all object characteristics.
* **Interactive Menu:**
    * Add new object
    * View all objects
    * Find specific object
    * Demonstrate object behavior
    * Delete object
